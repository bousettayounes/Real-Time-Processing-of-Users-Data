# üîÑ Real-Time-Processing-of-Users-Data

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive real-time data streaming pipeline using the Kappa architecture to process user data from generation to storage.
The solution leverages a suite of industry-standard technologies to transform raw user data streams into processed, queryable information through efficient real-time processing.

---

## Business Value
The solution enables real-time user data analysis while maintaining scalability through:
- Containerized deployment for consistent environment and easy scaling
- Schema validation ensuring data quality and compatibility
- Real-time processing of user-generated data streams
- Distributed storage optimized for high-throughput querying

This modern streaming architecture accelerates time-to-insight while providing reliable data processing, positioning your organization to respond instantly to user behavior patterns and trends.

## üîÑ Kappa Architecture Implementation

The pipeline follows the Kappa architecture pattern, focusing on stream processing as the primary paradigm:

- **Data Sources**:
  - Random Generator API producing user data
  - Continuous stream of events

- **Streaming Layer**:
  - Kafka topics organizing different data categories
  - Schema Registry ensuring data structure consistency
  - Control Center for monitoring and management

- **Processing Layer**:
  - Spark cluster for distributed stream processing
  - Real-time transformations and enrichments

- **Storage Layer**:
  - Cassandra keyspace optimized for write-heavy workloads
  - Data model designed for efficient querying patterns

**Key Relationships**:
- Kafka acts as the central nervous system for all data flows
- Spark consumes from Kafka and writes to Cassandra
- Airflow orchestrates the entire pipeline's lifecycle
- Docker provides isolation and deployment consistency

## üî• Data Pipeline Components

The data pipeline is structured into four major components:

### Data Ingestion (Kafka & Schema Registry)
- User data is generated by Random Generator API
- Kafka brokers handle the streaming data
- Confluent Schema Registry validates data structure
- Control Center provides monitoring capabilities

### Stream Processing (Apache Spark)
- Spark applications process incoming streams
- Transformations are applied in real-time
- Data is enriched and prepared for storage
- Processing includes:
  - Data cleaning
  - Format conversion
  - Feature extraction
  - Aggregations

### Data Storage (Apache Cassandra)
- Processed data is stored in Cassandra keyspaces
- Data model optimized for specific query patterns
- High-throughput write operations
- Eventual consistency model

### Workflow Orchestration (Apache Airflow)
- DAGs coordinate the entire pipeline
- Task dependencies are managed
- Error handling and retries
- Monitoring and alerting

**Highlights**:
- **Scalability**: Each component can scale independently
- **Fault Tolerance**: Resilient architecture with no single point of failure
- **Real-time**: End-to-end processing with minimal latency
